# Sensibly

An Acuity-like scheduling app for therapists....
(that might've devolved into an app to schedule time with therapy dogs).

## Technologies Used: 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)
- [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Vanilla JS]()
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Features:
Flask Authentication with Validation (Login and Register for Account)
Flexible Search Bar
User Profile Page

Accessibility was restricted when users were not signed in OR if users were not counselors:
Could not create appointments if not signed in.
If signed in as a user, you couldn't view a schedule of appointments (because you don't have one).
Cannot schedule appointments with non-counselors or view client profiles. 
Cannot view anyone's personal profile or therapist's schedule other than your own.

User Profile with edit functionality
User Recipe Posts
Recipe & Reviews Page

Recipe Page & Form with full CRUD
Nested Reviews & Form with full CRUD
